# HPE Storage FlowKit (Python)

A Python client library for interacting with HPE Alletra MP storage arrays.

## Overview

HPE Storage FlowKit is a comprehensive Python client designed to interact with the HPE Alletra MP storage platform. It provides a simple and intuitive API for automating configuration, management, and monitoring tasks via the array's REST web service interface (WSAPI).

The library provides control over  **high-level service clients** (Cinder) for common integration scenarios.

## Requirements

To use this library, your environment must meet the following requirements:

- **HPE Alletra MP OS**: Version **10.5** or later
- **Python**: Version **3.10** or later
- **Network Access**: HTTPS connectivity to the storage array's management interface
- **WSAPI Service**: Must be enabled on the storage array

Ensure the WSAPI service is enabled on the storage array before using the client.

## Installation

```bash
pip install hpe-storage-flowkit-py
```
